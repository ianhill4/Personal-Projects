# Sudoku Solvers

This project came to be because I was playing a Sudoku game during a flight. I had completed a puzzle, yet the game did not end, nor did it tell me my solution was correct. Out of spite, I spent the rest of the flight and the next day creating a Sudoku puzzle checker and solver. After everything, I found that the solution I had gotten on the plane was indeed correct, so I redeemed my meager Sudoku skills and, in the process, created a powerful Sudoku solver capable of solving even the hardest puzzles on https://sudoku.com/.

This folder contains three files. The first is "SudokuChecker.py," a simple Sudoku puzzle checker that confirms if a Sudoku puzzle is completed. The second is "NaiveSudokuSolver.py," a naive Sudoku solver that reduces the possible values for each tile and will only select a new value for a blank tile when it has one possible value remaining. The final file is "NondeterministicSudokuSolver.py", a nondeterministic Sudoku solver that uses a form of A* search to first reduce the possible values as much as possible, and then simulate the results of all remaining values.
