# Mini Golf Game

This project can be played at https://ianhill.itch.io/capstone

For my senior capstone in highschool I created a mini golf game from start to finish. Through this project, I learned about the entire process of game development. From 3D modeling in Blender, scripting with C#, and compiling a playable game in Unity I built this game on every level.
